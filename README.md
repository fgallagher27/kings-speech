# kings-speech :crown:

Here I use the Hotelling line to explore the optimal action when playing a family sweepstake of guessing the length of the kings speech at Christmas.

An accessible summary of the optimal strategy can be found in [`docs/summary.md`](docs/summary.md) whilst a full explanation can be found in [`docs/academic.md`](docs/academic.md).

The source code for deriving the underlying distribution of the length of the monarchs speech is available in R and python in the [`code`](code) folder.

Happy sweepstaking!
