# Closest guess wins

Here I use the Hotelling line to explore the optimal action when playing a sweepstake to guess the length of an event e.g. Kings Speech, Grand National, General election vote count until result is announced.

An accessible summary of the optimal strategy can be found in [`docs/summary.md`](docs/summary.md) whilst a full explanation can be found in [`docs/academic.md`](docs/academic.md).

The source code for deriving the underlying distribution of the grand national winning time in R and python in the [`code`](code) folder. The times are taken from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Grand_National_winners).

Happy sweepstaking!
