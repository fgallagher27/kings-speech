# Using the hotelling line in a closest-guess wins game

### 1. Intro

The hotelling model aims to explain why it is rational for companies to make very similar products despite the possibility of lots of variation[$^1$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotelling%27s_law). However, here we can use very similar logic to win a closest-guess wins game amongst mates. This logic is also robust to changes in the structure of the game, and the underlying distributions. We start by looking at a simple 2 player game where both players make their guesses at the same time i.e. by writing them down and revealing them. We then extend this to multiple players, before allowing the players to make sequential guesses i.e. going around the circle. We finish by relaxing other assumptions such as the underlying statistical distribution of the variable in question, all players having access to the same information.
